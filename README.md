Visitor Registration and User Management System
Objective:
Build a Spring Boot-based RESTful microservice that allows for the registration and management of visitors in a local relational database.

Features to Implement:
1. Visitor Registration
Create a REST endpoint for self-registration of visitors with basic details like firstName, lastName, email, contact etc

Collect and store the above details in the database:

2. CRUD Operations
Implement standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) endpoints for managing visitors.

Ensure proper validations on input data (e.g., required fields, valid email format).
3. User Listing
Provide a secure (basic auth or API key-based) endpoint to list all registered users.

4. Data Persistence
Use a relational database such as H2 (in-memory) or PostgreSQL.
